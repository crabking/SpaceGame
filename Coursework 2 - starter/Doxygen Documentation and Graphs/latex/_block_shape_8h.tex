\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class has some simple block body and drawing.

it currently draws and creates one block in the world and updates it.

This class was created to make some building blocks that would act as obstacles or similiary, due to other issues I had to pause this part of the project and just leave it as an OO class that has a decent block shape with reuseability when I would need it ni the future.
