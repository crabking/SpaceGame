\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class builds a fixed background, and because of that it doesnt really pass many arguments or have any special reuseability to it, its kind of just a seperate class that builds once instance of a background.

If I did not struggle with some things I would spend time passing these backgrounds in thorugh file.
