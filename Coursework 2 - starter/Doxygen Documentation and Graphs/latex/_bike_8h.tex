\subsection{Detailed Description}
The bike class that essentially builds a bike from different bodies and sfml drawings.

This class is not very object oriented in terms of reuseability. On the contrary its a very complex class with many different things added to it and is not really meant for building differently.

If I where to do different type of player cars I would probably restructure it a little bit in terms of loading in sprites from file etc.
